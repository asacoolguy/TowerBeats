TO IMPLEMENT
- currency based tower building
	currency counter 
	enemies destroyed increases currency
	tower build cost
- better tower building
	Clicking on build tower button spawns a transparent tower floating above the valid
		position
	We still have snapping to valid grid positions, but the transparent tower should float
		from position to position
	when building, the tower should drop down or warp in and appear inactive until 
		the scanner hits it
- pre-wave tower set up
	this let's players test out ideas and defenses before hand
	unleash wave button to release waves
	click on homebase to select a basic repeat beat
- tower upgrading 
	clicking on a tower will reveal buttons to upgrade the tower using currency
	upgrading a tower will increase its power, make it look cooler
	but how will its sound upgrade? (to be figured out)
- different enemy types and movement
	change spawn so less spawn but with more health
	enemies that go in different patterns
	enemies of various speed
	mini boss enemies that disable towers?
	
	
	
IDEAS
- tower moving
	clicking on a tower shows an option to move it,
	in moving mode, you can place it anywhere just like when you build a tower
	reuse the code for tower building here
- Rhythm game elements
	each tower has a keyboard key that you have to hit as the sensor hits it like a rhythm game
- hype level
	as the progress bar increases, the music gets more intense?
- audio visualizer
	somehow incorporate a cool looking audio visualizer into the game?
		maybe just 2d sound bars that pop up around the game field
		or have octagon/hexagon towers outside of the game field that move
			according to he audio 
- encourage good tower placement
	give towers bonus when placed in smart ways to next to each other
	give bonuses in such ways that encourage player to make good music
	but how? (to be figured out)
- variable keys
	the key of the tower changes based on
		tower level?
		distance to base?
	(to be figured out)
- variable tower heights
	base towers are on ground level, while vocals are floating? just an examples
- homebase upgrades
	applies to all towers
	some sort of global sound changing effect like dropmix's wild cards?
- levels with different musical genres
	maybe you only control the same X towers that always attack the same way
	but their sound changes based on the level. one level might be trap the other might
		be hip hop.
	you can use points you get from beating levels to permanently unlock a tower sound
		as your own so that you can use it whenever and also in the custom music
		making stage.
	
	
	
QUESTIONS
- how to upgrade towers
	just individually? as the level progresses?
	how does the sound of the tower change?
- changing the key of the tower
	should the tower's key change at all? if so, how?
- how to incorporate rhythm game elements?
	maybe the tap based gameplay will work if some of the towers change location to switch it up
	player can customize the music being played by purposefully missing some towers
	
	
	
TO DO 
- pre-wave planning stage
	sensor is just always going once the scene is loaded
	in pre planning stage you can click on a tower to move it
		move it to garbage can to destory it
- wave based gameplay instead of levels
- fix lagging issue
	reset the play timer per round of rotations for the sensor
	
- better looking blue bullet and scanner
- better tower building & tower moving
- try out rhythm game aspect 


BUGS
- when building a tower, if mouse goes off the grid the proposed build position should still be the last location
- any form of lag during the game will mess up the game's audio 
- clicking on other build buttons while already selecting a button will not build a tower but merely change the tower type
- players can cheese the game by just surrounding base with towers
